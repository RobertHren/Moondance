				<p>
From the man who mixed the inaugural volume of the seminal ‘Journeys By DJs’ series, gaining him entry into the Guinness book of records for being the first DJ to produce a commercially available mix CD, we still find Mr. Nasty at the helm, box of records at his feet, doing what he has done best for the last quarter of a century.
<p></p>
But Billy Nasty has never been just a DJ, he has enjoyed an extensive recording career and runs two record labels highly-regarded by a broad range of DJs and record buyers alike. With a career spanning 25 years, Billy continues to travel the world as one of the most in-demand DJs, lighting up dancefloors at some of the most prestigious events and infamous clubs across the globe. 
<p></p>
From early beginnings playing rare groove and funk to his first forays into acid house during his residency at London’s The Brain Club, to regular slots at seminal London clubs such as Final Frontier, Open All Hours, The Drum Club and Strutt, to having played pretty much every Festival and club worth mentioning ever since, Billy continues to DJ the world over whilst also maintaining a residency with esteemed electronic pioneers BLOC.
<p></p>
On top of his DJing, Billy Nasty has also maintained a strong production presence over the years. Earlier more progressive outings included Shi-Take (with Dave Wesson) or Vinyl Blair (with Chemical Brothers engineer Steve Dub) to his studio collaborations with Gregor Tresher and Anthony Rother on Datapunk, culminating in his current partnership with Keith Tenniswood (aka Radioactive) man as RadioNasty. 
<p></p>
In 2013 Billy relaunched his legendary techno and electro imprints, Tortured and Electrix, to critical acclaim. The debut release on Tortured was the RadioNasty ‘Breakin Bad EP’, featuring two stunning Ben Sims remixes as well as two original tracks. 
<p></p>
As RadioNasty the pair have unleashed several tracks over the last two years for labels such as Craig Richard’s The Nothing Special and EPM including the (relaunched) Tortured debut release 'Breakin Bad' EP and the 'Clave to the Rhythm' EP on Electrix. The guys were last seen disappearing into the studio bunker, planning the next slew of releases and collaborations, set to emerge over the coming year.
