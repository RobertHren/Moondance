				<p>
Buoyed by the whirlwind success he has enjoyed over the past six years, Alan Fitzpatrick begins 2014 at the top of his game and brimming with the confidence you would expect from a talent who is recognized globally as one of the most influential Techno artists of the moment. Having enjoyed a rapid ascent through the ranks since his emergence as the new kid on the techno block in the latter half of 2008, Fitzpatrick now holds a high status as a universally respected and in-demand producer and DJ who has succeeded in carving out a recognizable musical niche for himself within the ever-expanding genre of techno. A seemingly unstoppable source of hit music, Fitzpatrick’s productions seem to eclipse all those around him with tracks such as ‘The Tetra’, ‘In The Beginning’, ‘Always Something For Nothing’ and ‘Skeksis’ topping charts for sustained periods and in the process drawing high praise from his peers across the techno scene for the vibrancy, originality and inventiveness that has come to characterize Alan Fitzpatrick tracks. 
<p></p>
2014 saw the emergence of a broader sound from Fitzpatrick’s palette. Releases for James Teej’s ‘My Favorite Robot’ label and Paul Ritch’s Quartz Records or the still to be released remix of Stevie V’s classic ‘Dirty Cash’ exposed a more soulful, deeper sound that has its roots in house more than techno. However, it is Alan’s output for Drumcode in particular that has worked to grow his reputation as a maturing and dynamic producer capable of bringing stylistic variety to his productions. Releases such as ‘Skeksis’, ‘Always Something For Nothing’, ‘For An Endless Night’ and ‘Prometheus’ powerfully demonstrate the range of Fitzpatrick’s inventiveness in creating universally popular techno records that stand out from the norm. Whether he is adding diva-like vocals to cavernous beat workouts; fusing emotive chord sequences with his trademark heavy-funk sound or blending Jungle beats and Old School basslines with barnstorming Techno dynamics, Alan Fitzpatrick knows how to move the dancefloor. 
<p></p>
This same intuitive sense of what will move a crowd that so effectively inspires Fitzpatrick’s own productions has opened doors to Alan at a long list of high profile clubs across the globe and led to a coveted BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix in November 2011 that was met with an overwhelmingly positive reaction from old and new fans alike. Fans, who now can be counted as more than one hundred thousands, from all over the world, have witnessed Alan skills behind the decks as an increasingly busy and broad-ranging DJ diary sees Alan headline events across Europe, North America, Asia and South America while remaining a core artist on Drumcode’s showcase events, including ADE and Miami conferences, where his trademark tough, hooky grooves and incendiary beats compliment the brands musical template. Away from the main room, 2013 saw Alan flex his after-hours muscles on a more regular basis via a series of shows with London’s long-established after-hours event, Jaded, where Alan took on the role of resident, playing extended Sunday morning sets for the Jaded faithful in each quarter of 2013.
